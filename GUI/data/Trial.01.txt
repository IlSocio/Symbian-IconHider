IconHider v1.3
http://www.Symbian-Toys.com/

In the TRIAL version you can only hide 1 icon and you can't change the default Ghost Code *0000*
Buy the FULL version to hide up to 20 icons and customize the Ghost Code.

You can even hide IconHider itself.
If you hide IconHider, you can still launch it by dialling the Ghost Code *0000* and IconHider configuration panel will immediately appear.
